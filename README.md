# 🧠 NLTK Operations - NLP Text Analysis App

This is a simple and interactive Natural Language Processing (NLP) app built using **Streamlit** and **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**. It allows users to perform essential text processing operations like ASCII value checking, tokenization, and text analysis — all in one place with a clean and easy-to-use UI.

🌐 **Live Demo:** [Click to Use the App](https://sam-nltk.streamlit.app/)

## 🚀 Features

🔹 **ASCII Value Checker** – Check ASCII values of individual characters with a comprehensive reference table  
🔹 **Word Tokenization** – Split your text into individual words using NLTK  
🔹 **Sentence Tokenization** – Break paragraphs into individual sentences  
🔹 **Text to ASCII Converter** – Convert entire sentences to their ASCII representations  
🔹 **Text Capitalization** – Properly capitalize your sentences with first letter uppercase

## 📸 App Interface

The app features 5 interactive tabs:

1. **Check word ASCII** - Individual character ASCII value lookup with reference table
2. **Word Tokenizer** - NLTK-powered word tokenization
3. **Sentence Tokenizer** - Paragraph-to-sentence breakdown
4. **What computer see** - ASCII representation of entire text
5. **Capitalize** - Text capitalization tool

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### ASCII Value Checker
- Enter any single character to get its ASCII value
- Browse the comprehensive ASCII reference table (characters 33-126)

### Word Tokenizer
- Input: "Hello world! How are you?"
- Output: ['Hello', 'world', '!', 'How', 'are', 'you', '?']

### Sentence Tokenizer
- Input: "This is sentence one. This is sentence two! Is this sentence three?"
- Output: ['This is sentence one.', 'This is sentence two!', 'Is this sentence three?']

### Text to ASCII
- Input: "Hi"
- Output: [{'H': 72}, {'i': 105}]

### Text Capitalization
- Input: "hello world"
- Output: "Hello world"

## 🔧 Technical Details

The app uses NLTK's built-in tokenizers:
- `nltk.word_tokenize()` for word-level tokenization
- `nltk.sent_tokenize()` for sentence-level tokenization

ASCII operations use Python's built-in `ord()` function to convert characters to their ASCII values.
